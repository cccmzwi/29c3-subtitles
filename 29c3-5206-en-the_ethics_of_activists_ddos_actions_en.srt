00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:22,840
Hi, my name is Molly Sauter.

3
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,337
I'm currently a grad student at MIT in comparative media studies

4
00:00:26,337 --> 00:00:30,334
and I do research at the center for civic media at the media lab.

5
00:00:30,334 --> 00:00:35,448
This talk is going to be laying out an analytical framework

6
00:00:35,448 --> 00:00:37,168
that I've been working on for a while

7
00:00:37,168 --> 00:00:40,584
of the ethical analysis of activist DDoS actions.

8
00:00:40,584 --> 00:00:45,023
And though distributed denial of service attacks have been used

9
00:00:45,023 --> 00:00:49,201
as a tool of digital activism for roughly the past 2.5 decades,

10
00:00:49,201 --> 00:00:52,767
the past couple of years we have seen this huge explosion of the use

11
00:00:52,767 --> 00:00:54,882
and the tactic and the popularization of the tactic

12
00:00:54,882 --> 00:00:57,520
as well as a sharp increase in the attention

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,686
its use attracts for media and state actors.

14
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:03,687
All this attention has brought a lot of criticism and

15
00:01:03,687 --> 00:01:07,751
a lot of sort of support from various people in the digital space,

16
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:09,585
including digital activists.

17
00:01:09,585 --> 00:01:14,868
However both DDoS's critics and DDoS's proponents seek to declare the tactic

18
00:01:14,868 --> 00:01:21,090
as a whole as good or bad, without a nuance understanding the variety of circumstances in contexts

19
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,039
that can render the tactics use ethical or unethical.

20
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:27,217
So in this talk I'm gonna lay down the preliminaries for a framework

21
00:01:27,217 --> 00:01:33,129
by which to perform an ethical analysis of an activist DDoS action in individual use context.

22
00:01:33,822 --> 00:01:36,923
We're gonna go through a brief technical legal note

23
00:01:36,923 --> 00:01:40,103
which I assume I'm gonna be able to skip for this audience,

24
00:01:40,103 --> 00:01:46,169
criticisms of activist DDoS actions that have been thrown out in the past.

25
00:01:46,169 --> 00:01:49,752
Then we're gonna get in to the analytical framework that I'm proposing

26
00:01:49,752 --> 00:01:52,573
and then I'm gonna tell you a little about where I'm gonna take this

27
00:01:52,573 --> 00:01:55,952
as I write my thesis, which this is.

28
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,992
So everybody knows what a DDoS attack is, right?

29
00:01:59,992 --> 00:02:01,810
Raise your hand if you know what it is.

30
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,044
Awesome, I can totally skip this slide.

31
00:02:04,044 --> 00:02:06,411
<i>laughter</i>

32
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:10,706
DDoS action, distributed denial of service action by which

33
00:02:10,706 --> 00:02:14,870
you seek to monopulize the resources of a server or other resource

34
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,319
with your resources to prevent other people from using it.

35
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,212
Good, we're happy? We're happy.

36
00:02:20,212 --> 00:02:23,628
<i>applause</i>

37
00:02:23,628 --> 00:02:27,300
Alright, brief legal note: unlike this cat I am not a lawyer.

38
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,252
I do not have a law degree, haven't studied law.

39
00:02:29,252 --> 00:02:31,618
I worked at a law school for a while but that doesn't make me a lawyer.

40
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:37,045
So I'm gonna talk about legal things in this talk, do not take it as legal advice.

41
00:02:37,045 --> 00:02:42,900
So DDoS actions and DDoS attacks are illegal in most but not all jurisdictions.

42
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,625
In the US they are prosecuted as felonies.

43
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:51,938
Under title 10 section 1030 of the US Code which is complicated and which I won't read.

44
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:55,871
But just so that everyone is aware and this does have a bearing on my talk later:

45
00:02:55,871 --> 00:03:00,507
these things are very illegal and this has severe precautions

46
00:03:00,507 --> 00:03:07,815
for how organizers should treat them as they engage with them in their protests.

47
00:03:07,815 --> 00:03:13,289
So one of the major criticisms of DDoS actions is that they constitute censorship.

48
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:20,123
This is a very popular criticism among sort of "oldschool" hacktivists

49
00:03:20,123 --> 00:03:23,312
like cult of the dead cow hacktivism or other groups like that

50
00:03:23,312 --> 00:03:26,181
which have denounced the tactic as straight-up censorship.

51
00:03:26,181 --> 00:03:31,618
Basically they say you are impinging the movement of bits on the network and that's wrong.

52
00:03:31,618 --> 00:03:34,940
If we're going to be engaging in this type of electronic activism

53
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:39,349
we want to be encouring the movement of bits on the network, not stopping them.

54
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:44,839
This criticism privileges the integrity of the network and the rights of specific individuals

55
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:47,629
to unfettered flows of information,

56
00:03:47,721 --> 00:03:54,163
and it privileges that overpolitical ideals of activism in civil disobedience present in activist DDoS actions.

57
00:03:54,201 --> 00:04:01,118
This criticism also raises very specific unanswered questions about who can engange in censorship.

58
00:04:01,118 --> 00:04:08,670
Can in fact non-state actors and non-corporate actors be engaged as censorious bodies?

59
00:04:08,824 --> 00:04:15,026
And while DDoS is undeniably a disruptive tactic, does disruption of speech,

60
00:04:15,026 --> 00:04:19,413
particularly in context where the target has many other speech outlets,

61
00:04:19,413 --> 00:04:21,972
always equal a denial of speech?

62
00:04:21,972 --> 00:04:26,121
For instance when this tactic is trained against a corporate target

63
00:04:26,121 --> 00:04:30,410
while certain aspects of that organization's presence may be disrupted

64
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:35,510
their abiltiy to engange in political speech through the press and other outlets is not.

65
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:42,596
Therefore the criticism that you're engaging in censorship by waging a DDoS action sort of falls flat.

66
00:04:42,596 --> 00:04:49,073
Though the criticism is appropriate in some cases, especially when it's used against organizations

67
00:04:49,073 --> 00:04:54,174
that primarily exist online such as ISPs or independent blogs.

68
00:04:55,066 --> 00:05:01,524
Second major criticism is a sort of a revamping of this very old debate in activism.

69
00:05:01,524 --> 00:05:07,777
Direct action or symbolic/attention-oriented activism, which is better?

70
00:05:07,777 --> 00:05:12,427
And the anwswer is, one isn't really better, they are sort of different.

71
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:16,184
<i>applause</i>

72
00:05:16,184 --> 00:05:17,442
Thank you.

73
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:22,930
One group that's been particularly vocal about this in the past is a group called the critical art ensemble

74
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:27,945
which helped pioneer the idea of electronic civil disobedience in the 90th.

75
00:05:27,945 --> 00:05:33,314
And they critized groups like the electronic disturbance theatre for their use of DDoS in their actions.

76
00:05:33,314 --> 00:05:36,146
Saying that the use is ineffectual because corporations

77
00:05:36,146 --> 00:05:41,289
and states are now ??? waging "media war" with activists.

78
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:44,771
And it is ineffectual when compared with direct action.

79
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:49,989
In addition to just sort of being mean to attention-oriented activism for no reason,

80
00:05:49,989 --> 00:05:56,079
this criticism ignores the fact that DDoS is often used as a tool of direct action

81
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:01,378
Such as when it was used by the electrohippies in 1999 against the Internet

82
00:06:01,393 --> 00:06:04,594
that the world trade organization was using during their annual meeting

83
00:06:04,594 --> 00:06:07,686
or other groups that I'm gonna talk later about in this talk.

84
00:06:07,686 --> 00:06:13,005
The CAE's conception of DDoS also leaves the tactic

85
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:15,617
out of the context of larger actions that it is associated with.

86
00:06:15,617 --> 00:06:23,037
This tactic is pretty much never and frankly should never be used as the sole tactic in a campaign.

87
00:06:23,037 --> 00:06:26,768
It should always be used in the context with other tactics

88
00:06:26,768 --> 00:06:31,539
and it gets its ethical and politcal viability from the context in which it is used.

89
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:35,562
Not simply because of things inherent to itself.

90
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:40,356
Third major criticism: what is a successful DDoS action?

91
00:06:40,356 --> 00:06:48,715
Basically it's really hard to take down a large corporate website with an all volunteer manual DDoS action.

92
00:06:48,715 --> 00:06:51,977
If you and all your friends are really just sitting in your chairs

93
00:06:51,977 --> 00:06:58,173
hitting refresh a bunch of times on like paypal.com you're not gonna bring it down.

94
00:06:58,173 --> 00:07:02,331
So then what are we going to consider a successful DDoS action

95
00:07:02,331 --> 00:07:07,927
if we can't rely on downtime to be a measure of success?

96
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,594
So there are a couple of different answers to this questions.

97
00:07:10,594 --> 00:07:16,308
The first is we want to look at the value of the tactic as something which draws and focuses attention.

98
00:07:16,308 --> 00:07:20,129
And this is way more important now that it has become

99
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:24,618
much more of a media magnet than necessarily it was maybe 10 years ago.

100
00:07:24,618 --> 00:07:29,919
Another use for the tactic is the biographical impact on the participants

101
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,465
and expanding opportunities for engagement and participation.

102
00:07:33,465 --> 00:07:38,782
If you have never participated in a political action and you get to participate in a DDoS action

103
00:07:38,782 --> 00:07:43,424
and you're in the IRC channel with all of these new friends who you didn't know you had

104
00:07:43,424 --> 00:07:46,132
who you didn't know had the political views that you had

105
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,667
and you didn't know were willing to participate in ways that you are.

106
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:53,352
That has a huge biographical impact on you and it helps you consider yourself.

107
00:07:53,352 --> 00:07:57,329
And activism helps you move up the ??? the ladder of engagement.

108
00:07:57,329 --> 00:08:03,070
This enables what Ricardo Dominguez of the EDT calls a permanent culture of resistance

109
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:10,175
where resisting modes of power and resisting oppressive systems is part of the culture.

110
00:08:10,175 --> 00:08:16,002
And it isn't simple something you do for special on weekends but it is something that you do all the time.

111
00:08:16,002 --> 00:08:18,270
And the value of this symbolic resistence is

112
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:23,214
not necessarily its overt effect on the system that its ostensibly targets

113
00:08:23,214 --> 00:08:28,210
but rather its effects on participants and on the reflective fields that surround it as it occurs

114
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,201
including media and culture.

115
00:08:30,201 --> 00:08:36,920
Basically DDoS acts is a tool for the relevation of what James Scott called hidden transcripts of resistance.

116
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,518
It serves as an open action where an individual participant

117
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:43,511
can join a community of resistance with others.

118
00:08:44,896 --> 00:08:46,785
Moving on to the second major section:

119
00:08:46,785 --> 00:08:48,904
the analytical framework that I'm presenting.

120
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:52,997
There are four major parts of it that I'm gonna talk about in this talk.

121
00:08:52,997 --> 00:08:58,150
I'm hoping to expand to maybe five or six later, but not right now.

122
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:01,564
The first is intended effects and actual effects.

123
00:09:01,564 --> 00:09:05,567
The second is contacts within a greater campaign which we've already talked about a little bit.

124
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:09,218
The third is technology being utilized in the action.

125
00:09:09,218 --> 00:09:13,799
And the fourth is the specific participant and organizer populations ??at play??.

126
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:16,678
I'm gonna go through these one by one.

127
00:09:16,678 --> 00:09:19,277
The first is intended and actual effects.

128
00:09:19,277 --> 00:09:26,140
What I mean by this is what the group that is waging the action intends to happen by its use of the action

129
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,072
what actually happens.

130
00:09:28,072 --> 00:09:31,442
So there is a good example of this from 1997.

131
00:09:31,442 --> 00:09:40,047
It's called the IGC Euskal Herria Journal action and that's Basque and I totally butchered it but I'm not Basque.

132
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:44,763
Basically what happened was there was an ISP called IGC

133
00:09:44,763 --> 00:09:50,234
which was hosting a Basque newspaper publication, an online newspaper.

134
00:09:50,234 --> 00:09:54,338
This was during a time in Spain when the Basques were not terribly popular.

135
00:09:54,338 --> 00:09:58,068
There was a lot of violence going around Basque seperatives actions.

136
00:09:58,068 --> 00:10:06,772
A popular DDoS action was started by people who I don't know, so don't ask me,

137
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:10,876
to pressure IGC to take this website down,

138
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:16,500
the Euskal Herria Journal website down. People didn't like it.

139
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,880
It got a lot of popular support.

140
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,285
Actually several major newspapers in Spain eventually

141
00:10:22,285 --> 00:10:27,270
published target email addresses for email bombs and other things

142
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,745
until they eventually decided that was probably a bad idea

143
00:10:29,745 --> 00:10:32,937
and they retracted their support.

144
00:10:32,937 --> 00:10:37,135
But the stated goal of the actions was always to get the website offline.

145
00:10:37,135 --> 00:10:39,923
People didn't like it, they wanted it gone.

146
00:10:39,923 --> 00:10:46,529
Eventually it did go down because IGC was flooded with these packets and mail bombs and it was horrible.

147
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:52,639
It rendered inaccessible the websites and emails of their over 13000 subscribers

148
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,682
and they couldn't function as a business while this attack was going on.

149
00:10:56,682 --> 00:11:00,671
So they did eventually stop hosting the site but under firm protest.

150
00:11:00,671 --> 00:11:05,621
As an ISP IGC exists primarily in fact entirely online.

151
00:11:05,621 --> 00:11:11,186
Removing its ability to function online removes its core as an organization

152
00:11:11,186 --> 00:11:13,034
and its ability to function.

153
00:11:13,034 --> 00:11:17,284
So the goal of this action was to remove content

154
00:11:17,284 --> 00:11:23,682
by waging the action as long as the DDoS was successful the content was removed.

155
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:30,702
So actually the goal of the action was the permanent imposition of the state of the action.

156
00:11:30,702 --> 00:11:35,613
Its intended effects were its actual effects as it was occurring.

157
00:11:35,613 --> 00:11:38,586
This fits very well with the criticism that we saw before.

158
00:11:38,586 --> 00:11:41,304
This was actually just plain censorship.

159
00:11:41,304 --> 00:11:44,052
This was people saying: I don't like that you're hosting that content

160
00:11:44,052 --> 00:11:50,386
therefore I'm going to to make you not host that content until you don't host it anymore.

161
00:11:50,386 --> 00:11:55,073
This is not very cool and is unethical and bad.

162
00:11:55,904 --> 00:12:01,931
The second example that I have up here is the EDT electronic disturbance to Lufthansa action from 2001.

163
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:07,652
This is an example where disrupting content does not equal silencing speech

164
00:12:07,652 --> 00:12:11,063
as opposed to the example that I just showed which was depressing.

165
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:16,519
So in this example rather than removing content from the Internet

166
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:21,255
the goal of this action was to raise awareness of Lufthansa's

167
00:12:21,255 --> 00:12:25,739
allowing the German government to deport immigrants using its flights.

168
00:12:25,739 --> 00:12:31,457
It's part of a much greater action called the deportation class action.

169
00:12:31,457 --> 00:12:36,770
While the Lufthansa website itself was rendered inaccessible for brief periods of time,

170
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:40,889
the actual communications of the airline, its ability to fly planes,

171
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:45,971
maintain normal operations and communicate internally with itself and with the media

172
00:12:45,971 --> 00:12:49,624
remained for all practical purposes unaffected.

173
00:12:49,624 --> 00:12:52,500
So while the stated goal of the Lufthansa action was

174
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,835
to draw public attention to a specific aspect of the Airline's business model

175
00:12:56,835 --> 00:13:00,486
and through focused attention changed that corporations behavior

176
00:13:00,486 --> 00:13:02,767
it was actually rather successful in that.

177
00:13:02,767 --> 00:13:08,214
The airline did eventually stop allowing the government to deport immigrants with its flights.

178
00:13:08,214 --> 00:13:12,725
Though the action took place on the Internet the effect it sort of had

179
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:17,808
was not limited to, was not even really present in the online space.

180
00:13:17,808 --> 00:13:20,797
And in and of itself this action could not have achieved

181
00:13:20,797 --> 00:13:23,759
what the electronic disturbance theatre set up to accomplish.

182
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:29,623
It took positive behavior on the part of Lufthansa for the deportation class action to achieve its goals

183
00:13:29,623 --> 00:13:38,014
as opposed to the IGC example which was designed to accomplish its intended effects by gross fear.

184
00:13:38,014 --> 00:13:44,531
So the third example I'm gonna talk about is something called toywar, or the etoy/toywar campaign.

185
00:13:44,531 --> 00:13:51,865
The twelve days of Christmas campaign took place in 1999 and was an online attempt to draw attention to

186
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:56,161
a legal dispute between etoy which was a performance art collective

187
00:13:56,161 --> 00:14:04,279
and eToys which was a toy company, an ecommerce company that sold toys online

188
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:07,699
and they were fighting over the domain etoy.com.

189
00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:11,909
And writing about this is very kamikaze because etoy and eToys,

190
00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:14,649
you have to be very careful.

191
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:21,195
So this action was designed to draw attention to that legal battle.

192
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:27,590
But it had the additional effect of having a fairly significant impact on eToys' bottom line

193
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:30,969
because it took place the twelve days before Christmas

194
00:14:30,969 --> 00:14:33,704
which was the primary shopping season.

195
00:14:33,704 --> 00:14:37,170
And it did have a major how their website ran.

196
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:44,596
So though their main goal was this attention-oriented campaign in targeting this ecommerce site

197
00:14:44,596 --> 00:14:48,178
they were targeting the central purpose of their competitor.

198
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:53,460
They were attacking, they were going after what they were which is an online organization.

199
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:57,550
Etoy, the art ensemble, eventually triumphed in a court case

200
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:01,594
and claimed their role in the financial losses suffered by eToys Inc.

201
00:15:01,594 --> 00:15:03,321
that occurred over the course of that actions.

202
00:15:03,321 --> 00:15:05,639
Their stock price pretty much plummeted

203
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:11,003
which you can rather blame on the bubble or the action, whichever makes you feel better.

204
00:15:11,003 --> 00:15:20,536
So in this instance we have a combining of direct action and attention-oriented activism into the same action.

205
00:15:20,536 --> 00:15:24,968
The next part of the framework is context within a larger campaign.

206
00:15:24,968 --> 00:15:27,641
As I said DDoS actions very rarely occur by themselves

207
00:15:27,641 --> 00:15:31,067
and in fact if they did occur by themselves you'd probably never hear about them

208
00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:33,418
because there would be no reason why that site you like

209
00:15:33,418 --> 00:15:35,757
is down, it would just be down.

210
00:15:35,757 --> 00:15:39,252
Like physical world sit-ins DDoS actions must be embedded

211
00:15:39,252 --> 00:15:41,700
within a greater campaign of publicity and messaging

212
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,520
to ensure that content disruptions are registered by viewers

213
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:50,049
and passers-by as protest actions and not as mere technical glitches.

214
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:53,400
The EDT/Lufthansa campaign took place within the context of

215
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,837
a coordinated multi-pronged campaign

216
00:15:55,837 --> 00:15:59,041
which included physical world actions at stock holder meetings,

217
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,370
press releases and the distribution of special seatback

218
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,720
information cards on Lufthansa airlines that explained

219
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,206
what the protest was about.

220
00:16:07,206 --> 00:16:12,351
I don't know how they got them into the planes but they did end up in the planes somehow.

221
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:17,112
Similirarly toywar was also embedded within a larger campaign of press coverage.

222
00:16:17,112 --> 00:16:20,857
They were covered by Wired, the New York Times, and the AP

223
00:16:20,857 --> 00:16:24,306
and there were also solidarity actions and physical world actions

224
00:16:24,306 --> 00:16:26,389
at court houses.

225
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:29,559
So if you are going for this type of action,

226
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:32,242
it has to be embedded within many other actions.

227
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:35,256
It can't just be your sole activist ???

228
00:16:35,256 --> 00:16:39,158
You have to use with a bunch of other tools as well.

229
00:16:39,158 --> 00:16:42,957
The technology problem is a really interesting one.

230
00:16:42,957 --> 00:16:47,368
As I mentioned it's really difficult for a purely volunteer-based DDoS action

231
00:16:47,368 --> 00:16:49,425
to bring down a targeted site.

232
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,906
As a result we started to see the use of botnets,

233
00:16:52,906 --> 00:16:56,087
traffic multipliers, automated attack tools and other exploits

234
00:16:56,087 --> 00:17:01,373
to bring the power of such actions in line with the defenses employed by targets.

235
00:17:01,373 --> 00:17:04,889
While the use of such technological tools doesn't automatically

236
00:17:04,889 --> 00:17:08,466
negatively affect the validity of these actions,

237
00:17:08,466 --> 00:17:12,400
the use of non-volunteer botnets is the one thing

238
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,086
that is particularly worrying.

239
00:17:14,086 --> 00:17:17,622
And the other things do need to be considered within a larger context.

240
00:17:17,622 --> 00:17:20,489
Volunteer botnets present their own ethical concerns

241
00:17:20,489 --> 00:17:22,924
but are less immediately objectionable.

242
00:17:22,924 --> 00:17:26,865
Like marches, sit-ins and other crowd-based tactics

243
00:17:26,865 --> 00:17:30,436
DDoS actions gain their ethical and political validity

244
00:17:30,436 --> 00:17:33,641
from large numbers of willing participants.

245
00:17:33,641 --> 00:17:35,885
The use of traffic multipliers and exploits,

246
00:17:35,885 --> 00:17:38,887
while tempting to achieve downtime,

247
00:17:38,887 --> 00:17:46,533
undercuts claims by organizers that the actions represent a unified political voice of many different people.

248
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:50,573
So as an organizers, you would have to balance the

249
00:17:50,573 --> 00:17:53,668
"do I want downtime at press coverage" or

250
00:17:53,668 --> 00:17:57,104
"do I want to remain true to the number of participants

251
00:17:57,104 --> 00:18:01,484
that I have and value their participation over publicity".

252
00:18:01,484 --> 00:18:05,771
And this is something that lots of organizers have to deal with.

253
00:18:05,771 --> 00:18:10,409
Non-volunteer botnets, such as those that were used over the course of

254
00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:13,500
Anonymous's operation payback campaign in

255
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,694
addition to volunteer botnets,

256
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:17,169
they were used together,

257
00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:19,824
present a serious ethical problem.

258
00:18:19,824 --> 00:18:22,341
The use of someone else's technological resources

259
00:18:22,341 --> 00:18:24,459
without their consent in a political action,

260
00:18:24,459 --> 00:18:27,394
particularly one that carries high legal risk,

261
00:18:27,394 --> 00:18:29,503
like DDoS actions do,

262
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:35,023
is a pretty extremely unethical action.

263
00:18:35,023 --> 00:18:39,091
Moreover it cheapens the participation of activists

264
00:18:39,091 --> 00:18:40,784
who are consensually participating and

265
00:18:40,784 --> 00:18:43,920
makes it easier for critics to dismiss DDoS actions as

266
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,791
criminality cloaked in free speech.

267
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:51,008
Even though, again, it may be tempting to be like

268
00:18:51,008 --> 00:18:53,394
"oh let's just rent this creepy-ass botnet

269
00:18:53,394 --> 00:18:58,259
from wherever to bring down the site for five minutes"

270
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:02,888
Really not in fitting with ethical use of mass participation

271
00:19:02,888 --> 00:19:05,491
in political activism.

272
00:19:05,491 --> 00:19:09,398
This brings us to volunteer botnets such as those that were enabled

273
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:12,702
by the hive mind mode of low-orbit ion cannon, again,

274
00:19:12,702 --> 00:19:14,461
during operation payback.

275
00:19:14,461 --> 00:19:18,062
Participants could pledge their support to an action and then

276
00:19:18,062 --> 00:19:19,592
basically walk away.

277
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:21,667
They could say "great, use my computer"

278
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:23,894
"to DDoS whatever you want"

279
00:19:23,894 --> 00:19:27,666
"because I trust you and I believe that we are all fighting for the same cause"

280
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,945
"I'm gonna go walk the dog now"

281
00:19:30,945 --> 00:19:33,197
So they pledge their support for an action and place

282
00:19:33,197 --> 00:19:37,144
their computing resources under the control of the organizers of that action.

283
00:19:37,144 --> 00:19:42,064
This places on those organizers a strong responsibility

284
00:19:42,064 --> 00:19:45,355
to maintain open communication channels to participants

285
00:19:45,355 --> 00:19:48,807
and to not make significant changes to the operation of the campaign

286
00:19:48,807 --> 00:19:51,148
without the consent of those participants.

287
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:54,772
Changing plans, tactics or targets without the consent

288
00:19:54,772 --> 00:19:57,906
of the participant population constitutes a major breach

289
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:03,006
of trust and really should not happen.

290
00:20:03,006 --> 00:20:06,255
This brings us to the final ?? bit in the framework

291
00:20:06,255 --> 00:20:08,082
which I'm going to go over in this talk

292
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:11,631
which is different participant and organizer populations.

293
00:20:11,631 --> 00:20:14,548
The great thing about DDoS actions is that

294
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:16,498
they're relatively easy to join and

295
00:20:16,498 --> 00:20:18,867
they're fairly relatively easy to wage in the first place

296
00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:21,816
meaning many of these participants in these actions

297
00:20:21,816 --> 00:20:26,987
are inexperienced and unaware of the risks they could potentially be taking

298
00:20:26,987 --> 00:20:32,418
like accidentally committing a felony from the comfort of your own living room.

299
00:20:32,418 --> 00:20:35,857
Therefore it is ??? on organizers to make sure

300
00:20:35,857 --> 00:20:39,507
that all participants have enough information to usefully

301
00:20:39,507 --> 00:20:43,006
consent to participate in such actions.

302
00:20:43,006 --> 00:20:48,150
This includes information about risks that they could be taking

303
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:51,105
and ways to mitigate those risks.

304
00:20:51,105 --> 00:20:53,868
This was a very big issue in the fallout from

305
00:20:53,868 --> 00:20:55,403
operation payback.

306
00:20:55,403 --> 00:20:58,356
when during the course of the campaign a great deal

307
00:20:58,356 --> 00:21:02,217
of misinformation was present in organizing channels

308
00:21:02,217 --> 00:21:05,841
and the use of the low-orbit ion cannon tool was encouraged

309
00:21:05,841 --> 00:21:09,538
despite significant concerns about its security.

310
00:21:09,538 --> 00:21:12,789
Training should be provided to participants in ways

311
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:15,387
to mitigate risk and support should be provided in the

312
00:21:15,387 --> 00:21:17,874
event of arrest or other negative outcomes.

313
00:21:17,874 --> 00:21:21,791
This is similar to the way the physical world activists provide

314
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,871
training for their participants in the

315
00:21:23,871 --> 00:21:26,685
"we're gonna go outside today and we're gonna hold up

316
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:28,188
a bunch of signs and yell at some people.

317
00:21:28,188 --> 00:21:30,066
These people may yell back.

318
00:21:30,066 --> 00:21:32,336
These people may also try to physically harm us.

319
00:21:32,336 --> 00:21:33,774
If you're totally not interested in that

320
00:21:33,774 --> 00:21:35,904
that's ok, we still think you're cool."

321
00:21:35,904 --> 00:21:38,851
There should be that type of effort to educate and

322
00:21:38,851 --> 00:21:41,969
provide different channels for participation for electronic

323
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:46,231
civil disobedience in the same way there is in the physical world.

324
00:21:46,231 --> 00:21:48,888
There are two big things that I want to do with this model

325
00:21:48,888 --> 00:21:52,008
in the future as I continue to work on my thesis.

326
00:21:52,008 --> 00:21:55,502
The first is: I want to develop an analysis for

327
00:21:55,502 --> 00:21:56,986
state/state related actors,

328
00:21:56,986 --> 00:22:00,470
particularly patriotic hackers

329
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,768
and see how they fit into this framework

330
00:22:02,768 --> 00:22:05,537
and how the entrance of states into this area

331
00:22:05,537 --> 00:22:08,302
affects the ethical validity of these actions

332
00:22:08,302 --> 00:22:13,123
or whether we're just wandering full force into cyberwar territory there.

333
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,989
The second thing I want to do is adapt the framework

334
00:22:14,989 --> 00:22:17,933
from a reflective model, which it currently is,

335
00:22:17,933 --> 00:22:19,771
to a prescriptive model,

336
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:22,091
so be more useful to activists who want to

337
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:24,952
organize their own DDoS campaign and want to find out

338
00:22:24,952 --> 00:22:28,653
how to do it effectively and ethically.

339
00:22:28,653 --> 00:22:29,983
And that's actually it.

340
00:22:29,983 --> 00:22:31,502
Who has questions?

341
00:22:31,502 --> 00:22:42,203
<i>applause</i>

342
00:22:42,203 --> 00:22:43,778
Dude who stood up first.

343
00:22:43,778 --> 00:22:46,082
<i>Mike<i>: No other questions.</i></i>

344
00:22:46,082 --> 00:22:48,265
Hi, I'm Mike. I'm from Poland.

345
00:22:48,265 --> 00:22:51,514
I was heavily involved in the anti-ACTA campaign in Poland.

346
00:22:51,514 --> 00:22:53,526
I was not doing any DDoSes,

347
00:22:53,526 --> 00:22:55,553
I was doing the, you know, subject matter work.

348
00:22:55,553 --> 00:22:57,908
<i>Molly<i>: You don't have to incriminate yourself in this talk.</i></i>

349
00:22:57,908 --> 00:23:01,508
<i>Mike<i>: Yes. But I can, right?</i></i>

350
00:23:01,544 --> 00:23:03,909
<i>laughter</i>

351
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:07,641
<i>Mike<i>: Thank you for this talk</i></i>

352
00:23:07,641 --> 00:23:11,413
because I feel there is much to little talking

353
00:23:11,413 --> 00:23:17,896
about ethics in the whole DDoS and hacking area.

354
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,560
So thank you for this.

355
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:23,198
Second thing that I would like to add to this talk is that

356
00:23:23,198 --> 00:23:26,550
I think the framework works quite well

357
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:31,445
because there is a criticism that I am going to make

358
00:23:31,445 --> 00:23:33,484
about DDoS campaigns right now.

359
00:23:33,484 --> 00:23:38,444
That is already kind of handled in this framework.

360
00:23:38,444 --> 00:23:43,200
The criticism is that while the anti-ACTA campaign in Poland

361
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,529
was at full speed and doing stuff and people were

362
00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:47,860
protesting on the streets,

363
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:52,149
suddenly Anonymous started DDoSing Polish government websites.

364
00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:52,968
<i>Molly<i>: I've heard about.</i></i>

365
00:23:52,968 --> 00:23:58,294
<i>Mike<i>: And this had the exact opposite effect.</i></i>

366
00:23:58,294 --> 00:24:01,791
Maybe it was there, but I didn't see that in your presentation

367
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:04,421
that you have to be very very careful with

368
00:24:04,421 --> 00:24:05,590
DDoS campaigns

369
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:09,676
because they can actually cause harm to the cause

370
00:24:09,676 --> 00:24:11,339
that you're trying to do.

371
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:15,402
I think it was a little bit in the success part

372
00:24:15,402 --> 00:24:18,143
but I don't think it was highlighted enough

373
00:24:18,143 --> 00:24:19,573
that you have to be very careful

374
00:24:19,573 --> 00:24:21,637
because there is this huge framework,

375
00:24:21,637 --> 00:24:23,791
other actions that are happening.

376
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:26,621
And maybe, just maybe, doing DDoS right now

377
00:24:26,621 --> 00:24:28,822
might actually harm because it will give the

378
00:24:28,822 --> 00:24:31,272
government, as was this case,

379
00:24:31,272 --> 00:24:34,693
the government the excuse to actually do bad stuff

380
00:24:34,696 --> 00:24:35,993
that you don't want them to do.

381
00:24:35,993 --> 00:24:38,352
Because they will say: "Oh they're DDoSing our websites."

382
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:40,560
"They are hackers and we don't have to do

383
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,770
anything good for them."

384
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:46,954
Well done, because the framework already kind of works for that. Thanks.

385
00:24:47,416 --> 00:24:49,635
<i>Molly<i>: Yeah, I agree with that.</i></i>

386
00:24:49,635 --> 00:24:52,534
This tactic is right now extremely controversial

387
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:54,328
but people keep using it.

388
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:57,233
My view is that as long as we're gonna use it

389
00:24:57,233 --> 00:24:59,583
we should at least be using it in some sort of

390
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:03,530
reflective way in which we consider our actions

391
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:06,778
before we just do them.

392
00:25:07,502 --> 00:25:08,978
Dude over there.

393
00:25:08,978 --> 00:25:10,935
<i>Male<i>: Hi, I just have a question.</i></i>

394
00:25:10,935 --> 00:25:18,827
You said that disrupting a business which just

395
00:25:18,827 --> 00:25:23,048
relies on the Internet is unethical.

396
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:26,610
I just ask why you make this assumption.

397
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,926
I would make a different assumption.

398
00:25:28,926 --> 00:25:32,972
I would have said that maybe running an unethical business

399
00:25:32,972 --> 00:25:36,627
on the Internet is unethical and disrupting it is ethical.

400
00:25:36,627 --> 00:25:39,714
<i>Molly<i>: So, really good point. Yay.</i></i>

401
00:25:39,714 --> 00:25:42,825
<i>applause</i>

402
00:25:42,825 --> 00:25:46,717
Something that I didn't maybe have make clear is that each of these bits

403
00:25:46,717 --> 00:25:49,192
of the framework should not be taken as a

404
00:25:49,192 --> 00:25:52,427
"oh you didn't do that, therefore you are totally unethical."

405
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:57,225
This should all be taken as sort of a big lump of stuff which you can

406
00:25:57,225 --> 00:25:58,644
sort of massage and be like

407
00:25:58,644 --> 00:26:02,239
"well, you're 60% here on that and 45% here on that

408
00:26:02,239 --> 00:26:04,087
and we'll figure it out from there".

409
00:26:04,087 --> 00:26:06,195
Yes, you're right.

410
00:26:06,195 --> 00:26:08,322
That's actually sort of one of the issues that I'm really

411
00:26:08,322 --> 00:26:11,702
interested in looking at in the WTO/electrohippies example

412
00:26:11,702 --> 00:26:15,154
because I usually don't like it when people are like

413
00:26:15,154 --> 00:26:19,055
"I'm gonna protest you by making you fall off the face of the planet"

414
00:26:19,055 --> 00:26:22,009
That seems like a bit of an overkill to me.

415
00:26:22,009 --> 00:26:28,240
On the other hand disrupting the Internet for the WTO meeting

416
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,696
at the Seattle World Trade Organization meeting

417
00:26:31,696 --> 00:26:33,428
I'm kind of for that

418
00:26:33,428 --> 00:26:37,735
that seems like a good use of resources to me.

419
00:26:37,735 --> 00:26:42,342
So I'm very interested in pushing those weeds aside

420
00:26:42,342 --> 00:26:45,937
and figuring out when exactly it's ok to basically

421
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,220
attack the root of something,

422
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:52,189
as opposed to having a more symbolic protest

423
00:26:52,189 --> 00:26:53,878
which I'm generally more in favor of.

424
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:56,619
But you're right, I like you.

425
00:26:56,619 --> 00:27:00,005
We're just gonna switch to this mic and then we'll bounce.

426
00:27:00,005 --> 00:27:03,475
<i>Female<i>: I was wondering what your thoughts are on these action impacts</i></i>

427
00:27:03,475 --> 00:27:05,057
on non-participants.

428
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:08,935
Like say you DDoS eBay and then other companies lose business

429
00:27:08,935 --> 00:27:12,343
or you say DDoS a health care provider and people can't access health care.

430
00:27:12,343 --> 00:27:14,436
Is that a factor in your mind?

431
00:27:14,436 --> 00:27:17,989
<i>Molly<i>: Well, you sort of brought up two wildly divergent examples of</i></i>

432
00:27:17,989 --> 00:27:24,722
eBay which means I can't buy my awesome collectable Battlestar Galactica glasses anymore

433
00:27:24,722 --> 00:27:27,787
and my health care provider which means I can't get my tests

434
00:27:27,787 --> 00:27:30,922
from that thing that I had that may be cancer.

435
00:27:30,922 --> 00:27:33,776
Those seem like very divergent targets to me ,

436
00:27:33,776 --> 00:27:35,772
just to address that off the bet.

437
00:27:35,772 --> 00:27:39,285
Second point, yes, collateral damage is something that does

438
00:27:39,285 --> 00:27:41,344
definitely need to be considered.

439
00:27:41,344 --> 00:27:44,856
But it is not actually sort of specific to DDoS in itself.

440
00:27:44,856 --> 00:27:47,659
Like if you just stay sit-in at a lunch counter,

441
00:27:47,659 --> 00:27:49,941
I just wanted to eat lunch.

442
00:27:49,941 --> 00:27:52,571
I'm not a bad guy, I really just wanted lunch.

443
00:27:52,571 --> 00:27:56,543
But you have a political voice and you're using it to sit-in at this lunch counter.

444
00:27:56,543 --> 00:28:02,162
That needs to be part of the overall consideration of

445
00:28:02,162 --> 00:28:05,255
"do we think this is an appropriate tactic for whatever question is

446
00:28:05,255 --> 00:28:08,690
that you're trying to address with your activism at this time."

447
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:12,223
Because not all tactics are appropriate for all questions.

448
00:28:13,685 --> 00:28:14,567
<i>Female<i>: Thanks.</i></i>

449
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:15,871
<i>Molly<i>: Ok, cool.</i></i>

450
00:28:17,641 --> 00:28:19,030
That guy.

451
00:28:22,353 --> 00:28:25,433
Sorry, we have a question from the Internet.

452
00:28:25,433 --> 00:28:26,817
It hasn't gotten to speak yet.

453
00:28:26,817 --> 00:28:29,905
<i>Male<i>: I have this kind of comment and question.</i></i>

Thank you very much for your talk,

455
00:28:31,306 --> 00:28:34,030
it was very original material and I enjoyed it.

456
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:37,665
But however you announced to talk about the ethics of DDoS

457
00:28:37,665 --> 00:28:40,073
but you didn't say anything about ethics at all

458
00:28:40,073 --> 00:28:42,608
except for some personal beliefs.

459
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,965
<i>Molly<i>: <i>laughs</i></i></i>

460
00:28:43,965 --> 00:28:49,554
What kind of ethical framework would you actually suggest to use to analyze DDoS?

461
00:28:49,554 --> 00:28:54,131
<i>Molly<i>: The four bits of the framework that I set out.</i></i>

464
00:29:00,014 --> 00:29:06,442
Basically you cannot just say that DDoS is ethical or unethical.

465
00:29:06,442 --> 00:29:10,336
The way that I'm looking at, you have to look at it

466
00:29:10,336 --> 00:29:15,140
in the context of these at least four aspects, possibly more.

467
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:18,192
But you can't just simply slam your hand down and be like

468
00:29:18,192 --> 00:29:22,500
"nope, this one action which actually has very little political value

469
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,805
because it's just a bunch of bits swimming around a bunch of tubes,

470
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:31,437
has real ethical value."

471
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:34,012
I'm sure a lot of people were gonna be like

472
00:29:34,012 --> 00:29:37,363
"she's gonna say that DDoS is right or wrong one way or another

473
00:29:37,363 --> 00:29:40,157
and then I will feel good and/or bad about myself."

474
00:29:40,157 --> 00:29:41,711
<i>laughter</i>

475
00:29:41,711 --> 00:29:45,605
I'm sorry, that wasn't what was gonna happen.

476
00:29:45,605 --> 00:29:48,630
I'm far more interesting in looking at these very nuanced questions

477
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:52,298
of how this fits into political economy and protest methodology

478
00:29:52,298 --> 00:29:53,976
which is far squishier than just saying

479
00:29:53,976 --> 00:29:57,012
this is ethical or unethical straight off the bet.

480
00:29:57,012 --> 00:29:59,379
I hope that answers the Internet's question.

481
00:29:59,379 --> 00:30:02,126
<i>Male<i>: Yeah, I would also come back to the ethics.</i></i>

482
00:30:02,126 --> 00:30:06,644
Because I wouldn't like to start talking whether DDoS is good or bad.

483
00:30:06,644 --> 00:30:09,056
But I think DDoS is a very interesting example

484
00:30:09,056 --> 00:30:14,358
because it can make us question our ethics again

485
00:30:14,358 --> 00:30:16,946
because basically I, like you, I believe that DDoS

486
00:30:16,946 --> 00:30:20,484
is really a pretty violent act of censorship

487
00:30:20,484 --> 00:30:22,693
but I think it can be very often justified

488
00:30:22,693 --> 00:30:27,506
because this violent act can simply give us benefits

489
00:30:27,506 --> 00:30:30,291
that couldn't be made any other way.

490
00:30:30,291 --> 00:30:35,169
So basically I think that when we think about DDoS and when we want to act with DDoS

491
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:42,472
we have to think about violence and making violence an ethical act, actually.

492
00:30:42,472 --> 00:30:44,245
Your comment?

493
00:30:44,245 --> 00:30:47,337
<i>Molly<i>: Violence is a pretty prejudicial term.</i></i>

494
00:30:47,337 --> 00:30:49,097
I prefer not to use it.

495
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,324
You also notice that I usually don't say DDoS attacks.

496
00:30:51,324 --> 00:30:55,443
I try to say DDoS actions because attacks is also a pretty prejudicial term.

497
00:30:55,443 --> 00:30:59,961
I think a lot of the "violence" inherent in DDoS has a lot to do with

498
00:30:59,961 --> 00:31:04,728
the inherent power structures that play among the people who are participating.

499
00:31:04,728 --> 00:31:11,978
For instance, if I am a state government and you have a free press blog

500
00:31:11,978 --> 00:31:14,492
and you like to critize me in your blog

501
00:31:14,492 --> 00:31:18,780
and I hire a bunch of people to DDoS your blog

502
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,957
that's not really cool.

503
00:31:20,957 --> 00:31:22,613
That's fairly violent.

504
00:31:22,613 --> 00:31:27,073
I am silencing your speech using my superior power as a big state.

505
00:31:27,073 --> 00:31:31,340
On the other hand, if you are a private citizen

506
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:36,794
and you and a bunch of friends use floodnet to attack whitehouse.gov

507
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:41,012
I feel that there's less violence inherent in that system.

508
00:31:41,012 --> 00:31:44,577
<i>Male<i>: I would partially agree but I think that both acts</i></i>

509
00:31:44,577 --> 00:31:47,715
are violent but basically the ethics are different.

510
00:31:47,715 --> 00:31:52,166
So instead of avoiding the word I think that we should just think about the term.

511
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:54,362
That's my opinion.

512
00:31:54,362 --> 00:31:59,590
<i>Molly<i>: The grad student in me wants to come up with a new word, but yeah.</i></i>

513
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:03,426
<i>Male<i>: Hello, has the decision process who attacks</i></i>

514
00:32:03,426 --> 00:32:10,696
which website at what point any effects on the ethical part?

515
00:32:10,696 --> 00:32:12,049
<i>Molly<i>: On the organizing?</i></i>

516
00:32:12,049 --> 00:32:14,811
<i>Male<i>: Yeah.</i></i>

517
00:32:14,811 --> 00:32:17,327
<i>Molly<i>: I can't say that I do.</i></i>

518
00:32:17,327 --> 00:32:21,602
I think that falls into the purview of the people who are actually organizing these actions.

519
00:32:21,602 --> 00:32:24,731
As someone who is not an organizer I can't really comment

520
00:32:24,731 --> 00:32:28,756
on the organizing process, having never sat in one.

521
00:32:28,756 --> 00:32:31,610
Yes? That makes sense? Okay.

522
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:33,705
We're gonna switch back to this mic.

523
00:32:33,705 --> 00:32:44,463
<i>Male<i>: Aside from the coercive vs. non-coerciveness of volunteer vs. non-volunteer action</i></i>

524
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:49,069
which maybe falls into ethical standpoint

525
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:53,376
other than that, there's a question of liability.

526
00:32:53,376 --> 00:32:57,627
If you're for instance participating in a volunteer action

527
00:32:57,627 --> 00:32:59,661
and you have a packet sniffer going on that network,

528
00:32:59,661 --> 00:33:01,331
then you can trace it back to

529
00:33:01,331 --> 00:33:03,367
"ok you obviously volunteered to this action,

530
00:33:03,367 --> 00:33:06,160
therefore you're obviously culpable for those actions"

531
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:15,927
vs. if it's "box that's been compromised" and ???

532
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:21,528
that person is theoretically not liable for those actions

533
00:33:21,528 --> 00:33:27,331
because it was a ??? or a virus or ???

534
00:33:27,331 --> 00:33:28,823
<i>Molly<i>: Yes.</i></i>

535
00:33:28,823 --> 00:33:32,986
<i>Male<i>: I just wanted to point that out.</i></i>

536
00:33:32,986 --> 00:33:34,329
<i>Molly<i>: Yes, no, you're right.</i></i>

537
00:33:34,329 --> 00:33:36,218
That is a thing that also needs to be considered

538
00:33:36,218 --> 00:33:37,665
but it also comes back to

539
00:33:37,665 --> 00:33:40,897
"there needs to be more education" upon people who

540
00:33:40,897 --> 00:33:42,732
are organizing these actions to be like

541
00:33:42,732 --> 00:33:45,651
"hey, you know you could be committing a felony."

542
00:33:45,651 --> 00:33:47,143
"you could lose your house."

543
00:33:47,143 --> 00:33:50,834
"that's a thing that could totally happen if you get arrested in the course of this action."

544
00:33:50,834 --> 00:33:53,032
as oppossed to if you get arrested for chaining yourself to

545
00:33:53,032 --> 00:33:54,118
the ??? of the White House

546
00:33:54,118 --> 00:33:55,808
because you don't like the tarsands pipeline.

547
00:33:55,808 --> 00:33:59,329
You really unlikely lose your house in that instance.

548
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:02,139
This is something that I have a huge problem with.

549
00:34:02,139 --> 00:34:06,099
I think the state response to these actions is completely out of proportion

550
00:34:06,099 --> 00:34:10,294
and bad and chilling and not good at all.

551
00:34:11,464 --> 00:34:14,566
Until that changes there just needs to be

552
00:34:14,566 --> 00:34:17,678
way more education, way more informed consent happening

553
00:34:17,678 --> 00:34:23,613
among the activist population who participating in these actions.

554

<i>Male<i>: In terms of looking to the sources of products used to make DDoS,</i></i>

555
00:34:30,906 --> 00:34:35,892
how do you think about the ethical responsibility of a company based in Redmond,

556
00:34:35,892 --> 00:34:40,930
allowing with their products to very easy make big botnets

557
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:42,903
and use it for DDoS.

558

<i>Molly<i>: <i>laughs</i></i></i>

560
00:34:46,597 --> 00:34:51,404
DDoS is a crime so they could be forced to change this very easily.

564
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:00,489
until I learn more about it

565
00:35:00,489 --> 00:35:04,033
but we can totally talk about this, not right now.

I'm a grad student, sorry.

572
00:35:21,979 --> 00:35:28,293
<i>Male<i>: Do you really think that DDoS attacks will have a big role in activism in the future?</i></i>

573
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:36,141
Because I think the media interest in those kind of attacks is diminishing.

574
00:35:36,141 --> 00:35:42,580
When I think of, I mean, you talk about this partially as

575
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:45,895
very useful means of activism

576
00:35:45,895 --> 00:35:51,279
but when I think of DDoS I think of a few people sitting in their cellars,

577
00:35:51,279 --> 00:35:58,837
being bored in the IRC room and just hitting their LOICs just like they hit the retweet button

578
00:35:58,837 --> 00:36:00,789
and think they save the world

579
00:36:00,789 --> 00:36:05,525
I don't think that this will make any difference in the future.

580
00:36:05,525 --> 00:36:11,277
<i>Molly<i>: So you roled up a lot of things in that, including a valid, not-so-valid critism of slacktivism</i></i>

581
00:36:11,277 --> 00:36:13,263
which I will also address in this answer.

582
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:16,036
You're right.

583
00:36:16,036 --> 00:36:21,006
There are a lot of DDoS attacks happening, not a lot of them getting a lot of coverage.

584
00:36:21,006 --> 00:36:23,865
On the other hand there are a lot of street marches happening

585
00:36:23,865 --> 00:36:25,770
and not a lot of them get a lot coverage.

586
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:30,659
People still get their signs together and march in the streets sometimes.

587
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:35,327
There's a concept in social movement theory called the ladder of engagement

588
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:37,289
which is basically like it's what it sounds like

589
00:36:37,289 --> 00:36:39,459
you start at the bottom and you work your way up

590
00:36:39,459 --> 00:36:44,386
to more and more complex modes of political engagement over the course of time.

591
00:36:44,386 --> 00:36:46,738
You can't just jump straight to the top of the ladder

592
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:49,441
because you're not Superman and you don't do that usually

593
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:52,628
cause you'd fall off and hurt yourself.

594
00:36:52,628 --> 00:36:56,675
DDoS is a very useful tool to get on that first rung.

595
00:36:56,675 --> 00:37:01,208
It's easy, it's low financial cost,

596
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:03,751
it's generally pretty easy to advertise,

597
00:37:03,751 --> 00:37:07,338
it doesn't look like it will cost you a lot of time and money.

598
00:37:07,338 --> 00:37:11,124
All you have to do is really press a button and suddenly you are participating in this thing.

599
00:37:11,124 --> 00:37:16,787
The sense of participating has a big impact on something that is called biographical impact

600
00:37:16,787 --> 00:37:19,595
which is how you view yourself as an activist.

601
00:37:19,595 --> 00:37:23,744
It is really pushing people over the edge to view themselves as activists

602
00:37:23,744 --> 00:37:26,876
and the beginning is very very important.

603
00:37:26,876 --> 00:37:35,360
So while DDoS may not be "effective" or "successful" as a standalone protest tactic,

604
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:41,153
as part of larger system I think it is still useful.

605
00:37:41,153 --> 00:37:43,910
I think it will probably continue to be useful,

606
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:49,258
just like retweeting someone saying something vaguely political

607
00:37:49,258 --> 00:37:52,508
on Twitter is also useful.

608
00:37:52,508 --> 00:37:56,041
Or liking someone's status or sharing something on Facebook

609
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:59,579
or turning your Twitter icon green because you like the Iranian election.

610
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:02,642
No one in Iran cares that you turn your Twitter icon green.

611
00:38:02,642 --> 00:38:03,570
They don't even know you.

612
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:05,510
They don't know that you've turned your Twitter icon green

613
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:10,070
but what that does is that it connects you with all the other people

614
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,657
on Twitter who turn their Twitter icons green.

615
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:15,622
You can see all the other people who turn the Twitter icon green.

616
00:38:15,622 --> 00:38:18,012
Suddenly you're not just sitting there in your living room

617
00:38:18,012 --> 00:38:20,775
saying I really support democracy in Iran.

618
00:38:20,775 --> 00:38:24,823
You are part of this community of green people on Twitter

619
00:38:24,823 --> 00:38:27,171
who all support democracy in Iran.

620
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:30,405
That's way more powerful to you as a person.

621
00:38:30,405 --> 00:38:36,505
Not necessarily to anybody else. But to you as a person it matters. <i>laughter</i>

622
00:38:36,505 --> 00:38:38,845
And that's important.

623
00:38:38,845 --> 00:38:41,271
That's important for getting people onto that ladder of engagement

624
00:38:41,271 --> 00:38:43,407
and making them feel like activists.

625
00:38:43,407 --> 00:38:47,595
Feeling like activists is just a couple of ladders away from being an activist

626
00:38:47,595 --> 00:38:49,708
which is even better.

627
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:50,613
Yeah.

628
00:38:50,613 --> 00:38:57,492
<i>applause</i>

629
00:38:57,492 --> 00:38:59,048
<i>Molly<i>: They're clapping for you.</i></i>

630
00:38:59,048 --> 00:39:02,741
<i>Male<i>: <i>laughs</i> I'm from Austria and we have an organization</i></i>

631
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:06,929
in Austria, it's called Austromechana.

632
00:39:06,929 --> 00:39:17,837
Its website got DDoSes on May 11, 2012

633
00:39:17,837 --> 00:39:22,157
and they didn't get the website on until now.

634
00:39:22,157 --> 00:39:24,128
They used this as an argument:

635
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:27,255
"Oh my god, the Internet is so cruel."

636
00:39:27,255 --> 00:39:34,488
"It's bad and we can do nothing against them."

637
00:39:34,488 --> 00:39:44,690
"They play with... they have weapons we can't do something against it."

638
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:51,653
I'm not sure if in this case the DDoS was the right tool

639
00:39:51,653 --> 00:40:01,807
to get Aufmerksamkeit, attention.

640
00:40:01,807 --> 00:40:08,391
I'm not sure if it was helpful in this case.

641
00:40:08,391 --> 00:40:20,062
I don't think it's a good weapon for everything and there was not enough messaging with it.

642
00:40:20,062 --> 00:40:21,130
<i>Molly<i>: No, you're right.</i></i>

643
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:23,079
DDoS is not appropriate for all cases.

644
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:27,044
Given that I know nothing about your organization and didn't hear about that action

645
00:40:27,044 --> 00:40:30,258
they probably didn't have enough messaging.

646
00:40:30,258 --> 00:40:31,604
I don't know.

647
00:40:31,604 --> 00:40:33,496
But I'm sorry your website went down.

648
00:40:33,496 --> 00:40:37,008
<i>Male<i>: Not my website.</i></i>

649
00:40:37,008 --> 00:40:45,689
It was from the people who want to have the Festplattenabgabe, I don't know the English word.

650
00:40:45,689 --> 00:40:47,656
It was their site.

651
00:40:47,656 --> 00:40:48,523
<i>Molly<i>: Okay.</i></i>

652
00:40:50,399 --> 00:40:51,071
Hi!

653
00:40:51,609 --> 00:40:52,628
<i>Female<i>: Hi.</i></i>

654
00:40:52,628 --> 00:41:01,293
What exactly are your parameters for deciding if a DDoS action was ethical right or wrong?

655
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:03,919
I'm still waiting for this.

656
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:07,305
<i>Molly<i>: Like I said, this is a very holistic model</i></i>

657
00:41:07,305 --> 00:41:10,124
in that you look at a bunch of different factors and say

658
00:41:10,124 --> 00:41:14,473
"well, these things fell on one or either side of these different factors,

659
00:41:14,473 --> 00:41:16,671
therefore I'm gonna look at it, squint my eyes

660
00:41:16,671 --> 00:41:19,270
and say ok, I think that this was ethical

661
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:21,158
and that this was unethical".

662
00:41:21,158 --> 00:41:24,052
Like I said, this is probably much less scientific

663
00:41:24,052 --> 00:41:26,294
than a lot of people here were looking for.

664
00:41:27,294 --> 00:41:30,614
Liberal studies major. What do you want?

665
00:41:30,614 --> 00:41:31,947
<i>laughter</i>

666
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:36,743
So, this is not gonna give you sort of a tick list for things

667
00:41:36,743 --> 00:41:40,263
that you can say "oh we did this, oh we didn't do that

668
00:41:40,263 --> 00:41:44,266
therefore we're totally on the right side of god and the law".

669
00:41:44,266 --> 00:41:51,206
Instead what I'm hoping that this system will give people is a way to look at these actions

670
00:41:51,206 --> 00:41:53,426
to give them different factors to consider

671
00:41:53,426 --> 00:41:57,474
when saying yes this was appropriate or yes this wasn't appropriate.

672
00:41:57,474 --> 00:42:01,991
Cause I feel right now the debate right now is really a bunch of people being like

673
00:42:01,991 --> 00:42:04,143
"this is always awesome"

674
00:42:04,143 --> 00:42:05,228
and a bunch of other people going

675
00:42:05,228 --> 00:42:07,076
"this is never awesome"

676
00:42:07,076 --> 00:42:09,593
and that's not very useful.

677
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:12,046
<i>Female<i>: But don't you think that's quite outstanding that</i></i>

678
00:42:12,046 --> 00:42:16,310
you are the one who is getting to decide which is ethical right and wrong?

679
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:17,778
<i>Molly<i>: You can also decide.</i></i>

680
00:42:17,778 --> 00:42:20,228
I would love it if someone else would come up with a framework

681
00:42:20,228 --> 00:42:21,751
so that I didn't have to do all the work.

682
00:42:21,751 --> 00:42:23,915
<i>Female<i>: I thought it's your scientific study, so...</i></i>

683
00:42:24,315 --> 00:42:26,091
<i>Molly<i>: It's not terribly scientific.</i></i>

684
00:42:26,091 --> 00:42:29,540
It's me reviewing a bunch of case studies

685
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,415
and saying these are the things that happened,

686
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:35,929
this is were they fall on these different factors

687
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:38,725
and this is now what I think of this action.

688
00:42:38,725 --> 00:42:43,656
For instance, Lufthansa/EDT action, I think that actually was ethical.

689
00:42:43,693 --> 00:42:48,358
I think it was ethical because it occurred within the framework of a much larger campaign

690
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:57,041
because it focused on a corporate website that didn't attack the central core of the corporation.

691
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:58,472
It didn't stopped it from communicating,

692
00:42:58,472 --> 00:43:01,229
it didn't stop it from responding to the action,

693
00:43:01,229 --> 00:43:04,858
it just made itself known in that way.

694
00:43:04,858 --> 00:43:07,311
And it did a great deal of publicity work.

695
00:43:07,311 --> 00:43:09,972
In the end it actually worked,

696
00:43:09,972 --> 00:43:12,825
The effect that it wanted to have in that,

697
00:43:12,825 --> 00:43:16,456
they wanted Lufthansa to stop flying immigrants out of the country,

698
00:43:16,456 --> 00:43:17,634
actually took place.

699
00:43:17,634 --> 00:43:20,892
And that also has an impact on the ethical validity of an action

700
00:43:20,892 --> 00:43:23,412
which is why this is currently a reflective framework

701
00:43:23,412 --> 00:43:25,031
and not a prescriptive framework.

702
00:43:25,031 --> 00:43:28,613
<i>Female<i>: Thanks. Good luck with your studies then.</i></i>

703
00:43:28,613 --> 00:43:30,322
<i>Molly<i>: Yay.</i></i>

704
00:43:31,722 --> 00:43:33,220
There's another question.

705
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:37,965
<i>Male<i>: My naive approach to judge the ethics of a DDoS attack</i></i>

706
00:43:37,965 --> 00:43:41,315
would have been to compare it to usual demonstrations,

707
00:43:41,315 --> 00:43:43,405
just marching on the street.

708
00:43:43,405 --> 00:43:47,290
Because I guess what has a rather good feeling on what the ethics are there.

709
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:49,602
You didn't highlight that too much in your talk.

710
00:43:49,602 --> 00:43:52,337
Was this on purpose or can you say something about that?

711
00:43:52,337 --> 00:43:57,148
<i>Molly<i>: People really like, and lots of people really like to say</i></i>

712
00:43:57,148 --> 00:44:02,030
"oh DDoS is just a sit-in, except on the Internet".

713
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:04,438
I really don't like that comparison.

714
00:44:04,438 --> 00:44:12,023
I think it's really attractive because it sort of feels like a sit-in,

715
00:44:12,023 --> 00:44:14,969
You feel like you are monopolizing resources in the same way

716
00:44:14,969 --> 00:44:17,455
that sitting in a lunch counter is monopolizing resources.

717
00:44:17,455 --> 00:44:22,339
But it's not in the physical world, it's on the Internet.

718
00:44:22,339 --> 00:44:24,272
And frankly, these are two different things.

719
00:44:24,272 --> 00:44:27,035
We can't just say "oh this is just like it"

720
00:44:27,035 --> 00:44:27,856
because it's not.

721
00:44:27,856 --> 00:44:30,371
What it is just like, it is just like a DDoS.

722
00:44:30,371 --> 00:44:33,085
It's not just like a sit-in.

723
00:44:33,085 --> 00:44:37,001
Disruptive tactics in both areas are very parallel

724
00:44:37,001 --> 00:44:39,457
but they are very different.

725
00:44:39,473 --> 00:44:43,281
That is something that I want to go into much greater detail on,

726
00:44:43,281 --> 00:44:47,760
specifically both in sort of the socially acceptable disruptive tactics

727
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,550
like sit-ins and street marches

728
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:52,311
but also the non-socially-acceptable disruptive tactics

729
00:44:52,311 --> 00:44:54,732
like black bloc tactics.

730
00:44:54,732 --> 00:44:57,592
I'd really love to compare that to other modes of

731
00:44:57,592 --> 00:44:59,576
disruptive activism online,

732
00:44:59,576 --> 00:45:01,957
and other modes of disruptive activism

733
00:45:01,957 --> 00:45:03,531
and destructive activism.

734
00:45:03,531 --> 00:45:07,067
So that is, if you are interested in reading my Master's thesis,

735
00:45:07,067 --> 00:45:09,294
I will have a whole chapter on this

736
00:45:09,294 --> 00:45:12,344
that I could not fit into this talk.

737
00:45:12,344 --> 00:45:15,392
Because there is a lot of that there.

738
00:45:15,392 --> 00:45:19,647
But the instinct to fall back on the physical analogy is,

739
00:45:19,647 --> 00:45:22,412
I think, inherently damaging to the discourse of

740
00:45:22,412 --> 00:45:27,076
electronic civil disobedience and digital activism

741
00:45:27,076 --> 00:45:29,679
because you fall back on these tropes

742
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:31,998
that don't really fit and then

743
00:45:31,998 --> 00:45:34,591
when people point out that they don't really fit

744
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:37,230
you're sort of left with nothing.

745
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:39,944
When you say like "that's not actually a sit-in, that's a DDoS"

746
00:45:39,944 --> 00:45:42,771
you sitting there going "but I said it was a sit-in

747
00:45:42,771 --> 00:45:44,981
and you like sit-ins, right?"

748
00:45:44,981 --> 00:45:47,580
and then you're sort of: that's it.

749
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:51,479
So I'd like to push the argument beyond that point.

750
00:45:51,479 --> 00:45:53,110
<i>Male<i>: Thanks.</i></i>

751
00:45:54,680 --> 00:46:01,145
