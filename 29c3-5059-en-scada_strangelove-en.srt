00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:15,428
Herald: Hi, Welcome to this apparently very popular talk

2
00:00:15,528 --> 00:00:20,234
because there are still like around 20 people besides this door

3
00:00:20,334 --> 00:00:26,051
so there is obviously big interest in this topic

4
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:31,299
lets welcome our speakers from Positive Technologies:

5
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:36,421
Sergey Gordeychik and Gleb Gritsai.

6
00:00:36,521 --> 00:00:37,521
Applause.

7
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:46,412
<applause>

8
00:00:46,512 --> 00:00:50,016
Speakers: Thanks everybody who has arrived.

9
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:59,058
First of all I want to say that SCADA Strangelove is a collective approach, its collective product

10
00:00:59,158 --> 00:01:07,405
and we're just frontmen. With our team, I think this [...] a lot of applause.

11
00:01:07,505 --> 00:01:10,314
This guys work at 

12
00:01:10,414 --> 00:01:15,878
<applause>

13
00:01:15,978 --> 00:01:18,660
So, why are here?

14
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:28,145
Because according to our information, our analysis, Europe, worst protected region in the world

15
00:01:28,245 --> 00:01:32,698
if we look from SCADA security perspective.

16
00:01:32,798 --> 00:01:40,159
Most of SCADA systems exposed to Internet have well known vulnerabilities

17
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:46,546
like default passwords, default configuration, and error(?).

18
00:01:46,646 --> 00:01:51,857
Italy [is] first in this list. Why? I don't know

19
00:01:51,957 --> 00:01:53,628
Maybe because it is Italy

20
00:01:53,728 --> 00:02:01,722
<applause>

21
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:09,815
Special Thanks to Siemens ProductCERT. I don't know whether there are guys from Siemens here.

22
00:02:09,915 --> 00:02:17,909
Thanks again because they're really professionals and I was really surprised because,

23
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:24,991
they not only provide [...] quick response to email but even provide patches.

24
00:02:25,091 --> 00:02:29,607
It's something unusal in ICS industy.

25
00:02:29,707 --> 00:02:34,286
<applause>

26
00:02:34,386 --> 00:02:42,064
I will talk a lot about Siemens. Why? Because Siemens is elephant

27
00:02:42,164 --> 00:02:46,806
Siemens is everywhere. It's most common target during our penetration test.

28
00:02:46,906 --> 00:02:50,600
during search in Internet
