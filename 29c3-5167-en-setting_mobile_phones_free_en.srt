99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
[Applaus]

2
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Ok, thank you!

3
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I don't like crowded slides, so this is the most crowded slice I have.

4
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
What I'm gonna talk about is the telephony industry.

5
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And what we know about the telephony industry is,

6
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that it has been a long time been a closed sector.

7
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And for fixed lines, and now we have the internet, there's voice-over-IP,

8
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
things are going better.

9
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But this is not the case for mobile.

10
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And one of the things, that is really changing the landscape,

11
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
is voice-over-IP, the Session Initiation Protocol and things like that.

12
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And there are some kinds of extraordinary open source projects going on;

13
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
like OpenMoko.

14
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
What they are doing is, they want to create open source software

15
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
to run on your cell phone to get rid of all the closed-source things that are in there.

16
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And on the network side people are working on projects like OpenBTC and OpenBDSC to create,

17
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
actually, the infrastucture you can use to build a network, based on open-source software.

18
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Ahm..., at this conference we have one of those networks running, actually.

19
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But there's still something missing.

20
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Who of you is using a cell phone right now?

21
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
[Murmurs in the Audience]

22
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Ok, so who of you have completly open-sourced the network and the, the hardware?

23
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I see nobody

24
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
There isone particular reason: There is one thing we are missing,

25
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and that's national coverage.

26
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And there's the ease of use: That you can be anywhere in this country,

27
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
or in another country, you can pick up your cell phone and you can call.

28
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
You can reach anybody, you can be connected anywhere you are.

29
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And that's what we where missing. And that's why we started the project Limesco.

30
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Our aim is to be a network operator, or a phone operator.

31
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Not completely open-source yet, that's the long term goal,

32
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
but that's not where we are right now.

33
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But we want to go there.

34
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
We're three founders.

35
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I'm just one of them.

36
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
The other two are sitting in the front row;

37
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
they deserve an applause anyway.

38
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
[Applause]

39
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I'm only doing the scary part here.

40
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But it started about two years ago

41
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and we were just chatting in IRC about, well,

42
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
there are some things we don't like.

43
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
There are roaming charges.

44
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And sometimes they're ridiculous.

45
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And once we started the project, we actually learned there were charges far higher, than we even knew.

46
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
There are providers, when you roam in -for example- Australia, you pay 80€ per megabyte for data.

47
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But there was a lot of lack of transparancy.

48
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Or actually there is a lot of lack of transparency.

49
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
One of the things whe noticed in the Netherlands is, that if you have SIM-only packages,

50
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and you have package deals, were you get SIM-cards and a phone with it.

51
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But these are incomparable.

52
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
For Example: When you want to get a package deal, you can choose for a package

53
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
with 400, 600, 800 or 1000 minutes.

54
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But if you want a SIM-only, you can choose for 250, 450, 670 and...

55
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So, what I want to do is, I want to calculate my total cost of ownwership over two, or maybe three years,

56
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
given in to account my calling, my texting, my data uses and the device I have.

57
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
This isn't easy.

58
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
There a lot of other things, that I'm not going to dive into that in this presentation.

59
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But one of the things that keeps getting back is supscription bundles.

60
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
They rock and they suck!

61
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But they are a perfect marketing tool.

62
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Because this is what you can say:

63
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
"You can call using our plan from 3.4 ct/min"

64
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
which is actually true, you can do the maths.

65
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But this is only true if you call for exactly 550 minutes.

66
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
If you pay half of it one month, you pay actually 7 ct/min.

67
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So, OK.

68
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But... [pause], what if you pay more?

69
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Out of bundle charges?

70
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Well, then we just charge 30 ct/min.

71
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And we can do that, because it is written in small letters, in small print

72
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and nobody ever reads it.

73
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Ahm, but there is another trick.

74
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And that is unitization.

75
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And in the Netherlands it's getting a hot topic.

76
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
In the telephony industry it is very used to pay per second and a start-fee for a single connection.

77
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So for example, and this is something from our price sheet, there is a cost per call of 4ct,

78
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
which means you pay the 4ct, no matter what the length of your... ahm, the duration of your call is.

79
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And you pay 10 ct. per minute.

80
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Your cost per minute.

81
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Now, if you're doing this and you're going to call for two minutes and ten seconds,

82
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
you can do the maths.

83
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
It's 26 ct.

84
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
OK, cool!

85
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Now, ahm, there is something of a start fee, and we could do marketing again:

86
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
"We don't have a start-fee! Cool!"

87
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
What we don't say is, we also, ah, we let you pay per minute, and not per second.

88
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So the same conversation is again now to minutes and ten seconds.

89
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And we do it three times ten cents, and it's more!

90
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
It's just the simple things, and if you don't compute the details, then you are going to pay more.

91
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Now, then there is another trick:

92
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Because, hey, because we don't want to round by minute, but, we do the first.

93
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I'm not going to do the maths, it's actually better than to round everything.

94
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But with data sessions there is another trick in the sleeves.

95
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Let's say we do 20 ct/MB when you're roaming within the EU, OK?

96
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
It's. it's fair.

97
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Ahm, we unitize by blocks of a 100kB, ok that's fair, I've seen worse.

98
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Ten megabytes for example. Per session!

99
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Which means if you are in a train, and the session is dropped for a moment and a in a couple of seconds

100
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
you get a new session, we start counting towards the 100kB.

101
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And for youTube, which you should not do when you're aborad and you are roaming,

102
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
this might not be a problem, but when you're doing SSH and you are just doing little data.

103
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But if you spread it over sessions it will get a lot of blocks.

104
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Now, my Android-phone can measure my usage, but you're operator may measure data usage differently.

105
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
For example: Per session.

106
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Now when we're talking about what is in the industry in the Netherlands, ahm,

107
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
what companies are involved, there are actually three types of companies we're ´going to look at.

108
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And fist there are the MNO's, which are the MObile Network Operators.

109
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And in the Netherlands, we have three of them at the moment.

110
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
The largest is KPN, it is a former state-controlled company.

111
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
They have about 50% market-share in mobile.

112
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
The second is Vodafone.

113
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
They have about 25% of market-share, and they are from britain.

114
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
The german T-Mobile, which has the remainder 25%.

115
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And we just had an auction for frequencies and Tele2 is going to join them soon.

116
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
2013

117
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So things might change soon.

118
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And another thing, that might be interesting for people in Germany too:

119
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
E-Plus actually is KPN.

120
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Now those are the three MNO's, and they have a network.

121
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
They have antennas.

122
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And they have an infrastructure to connect antennas to the remainder of the telephone industry.

123
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But those are not the only companies, where you can buy your plan, your subscription, from.

124
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And that's what we call "Vitual Mobile Network Operators".

125
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
They are virtual, because they don't need to have their own infrastructure.

126
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And in the Netherlands we have around 50.

127
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Ahm..., some of them are actually brands of the larger companies.

128
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Some of them are small, targeted towards a niche.

129
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
For example, there is an operator specifically targeting people from Surinam.

130
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But they are the brands you can see in a store, that you can buy.

131
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
One of them is "SpeakUp". It's a little less known, ahm, one.

132
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
This is the one I'm going to talk about in a moment again.

133
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
SpeakUp is the one we're working together with.

134
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Limesco officially is not an MVNO,

135
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
because if we say we are we're getting in a fight, and we don't like that.

136
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So, officially we are a reseller of SpeakUp, and Speak-Up is an MVNO.

137
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And SpeakUp is using the network of T-Mobile, the antennas of T-Mobile.

138
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But there is a company inbetween.

139
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And this is called a MVNE.

140
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
A Mobile Virtual Network Enabler.

141
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And we have four of them in the Netherlands.

142
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
There were five, but one of them went broke last year.

143
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Aspider Solutions which offer services using the KPN Network.

144
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
There's Teleena, which have a nice network all IP-based.

145
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
They're offering services using Vodafone network.

146
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And on the T-Mobile network we have two:

147
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
ElephantTalk and NarrowMinds

148
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
[laugher from the audience]

149
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So, when you're a subscriber of Limesco actually this is the chain of companies involved.

150
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
T-Mobile is the one that owns and operates the antennas,

151
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
ElephantTalk has quite a bit of infrastructure in the middle

152
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and SpeakUp and Limesco, we together, take care that you as the customer get your bill.

153
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So, the most important thing MNO's are doing is taking care of antennas.

154
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And the most important thing an MVNO is doing is subscribers and marketing,

155
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and everything inbetween you can shift around.

156
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So, going a little more into technical details, a HLR, a Home Location Register,

157
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
which in GSM is a compontent which is actually a database,

158
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
where all customers are listed with their SIM-card number and their key...,

159
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
encryption keys to communicate and perform authentication.

160
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
In our case this is shared between T-Mobile and Elephant Talk.

161
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
VLR is the Visitor Location Register.

162
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
When you're roaming to another country or to another operator,

163
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
you're subscribed into VLR.

164
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So the network knows what to do.

165
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Ahem, this is actually not important to us, because we don't actually have our own network.

166
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But T-Mobile has a VLR, so iwhen you, as a Limesco Subscriber or from an other customer goal

167
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
are travelling to Germany and log on to the T-Mobile network,

168
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
you'll be subscribed in the VLR.

169
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
The SMS-Center also is managed by Elephant-Talk,

170
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and the GPRS-Gateway-Support-Node, which is actually the gateway to the internet,

171
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
is also managed by Elephant-Talk in our situation.

172
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But this can move, so for other MVNOs it may mean, that they're handling the SMS-Center themselves or something.

173
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
What we have as ambition, is that we want to do more ourselves.

174
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
For example the GGSN.

175
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Because if we have control to the gatway of the internet, we can give more control to the end user.

176
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Another thing which you can shift around is number blocks.

177
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Ahm, alot of brands that are operated by KPN have one huge number block,

178
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
which is by KPN and is just shared among them.

179
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
While at the other side, in our case we make use of a number block whisch is registered to SpeakUp.

180
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And [inaudible] routing.

181
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
This is one... This is very interesting in our case.

182
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
You can leave things higher up in the network,

183
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
you can let T-Mobile do the interconnection and you can make routing decisions and you can say to T-Mobile:

184
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
"Just route it to there!"

185
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But in our case, what we're doing is: "Just route every call to us!"

186
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And then we can make the dicisions in the end.

187
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Which I'm going to do in ahh, tell a little more in a [incomprehensable] at the end of the presentation.

188
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But one of the interesting things we've been investigating in the last to years is pricing.

189
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Pricing is different for MNOs, MVNEs and MVNOs.

190
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So let's star with MNOs.

191
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
What is the situtation for an MNO?

192
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
You have a couple of costs.

193
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So first of all you have a lot of antennas, and you have infrastructure.

194
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And these two tend to be expensive.

195
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Because they are closed source under a lot of support contracts, and everything involved.

196
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But this is equity.

197
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
You own them as  a network operator, or you lease them.

198
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And when you lease them, you don't need to have a large upfront payment to buy all the antenna's to create national coverage.

199
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But they are owned by a network supplier or by the manufacturer.

200
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And you lease them and pay by month.

201
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Which is cool as an operator, because know you know you have a certain amount of costs every months,

202
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and you must make sure you have income to cover those costs.

203
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Now if you choose as an operator to own them, to own the hardware,

204
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
you have a lot of upfront costs and you use armotization to, ahem,

205
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
in accounting to spread the cost over a longer period.

206
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Ahem, this is somthing that happens in accounting for every company,

207
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
the cost for the network operators is just a little higher than for a small company.

208
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
You have now, in your books, a certain amount of money you have to pay every month,

209
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
so you have to get income.

210
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
The easiest thing you can do is just: Charge your MVNE per month.

211
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And that's nice, because you can say: Whatever happens, you need to pay me 1 million Euro's every month anyway.

212
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
If people are calling it or not, I don't care, you need to pay.

213
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
That's happening.

214
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
The next at, ahem, next is there are some administrative tasks.

215
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And depending on how things are arranged, there are more or less of them,

216
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
but porting a number, transferring it from one provider to another provider,

217
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and [incomprehensible] task,

218
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
ahem, ah, calling people in bad.. when you have bad tempts,

219
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
calling people to get those, ahem, to get your money.

220
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
It's all administrative actions which you want to do.

221
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And they raise a charge for usage.

222
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
By the way, you can make up any way, as an MNO, you can make up any way of

223
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
charging your MVNE.

224
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
The thing is: It must be reasonable, because if it is not, they will not accept it.

225
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But you're free to do.

226
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
What you're actually do is spreading the cost of your hardware over a large customer base.

227
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Now, if you're going to do that, you can set up a cost per call, and a cost per minute.

228
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
We have already seen those.

229
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But the interesting thing is, what you're selling is airtime, acces to the frequencies.

230
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So you can do it in both directions, both for outgoing and incoming calls.

231
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And we call that by the way, mobile originated, when your mobile starts it.

232
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And we're used to pay as a customer, when we start a call,

233
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
but also network initiated, so going from the network to the mobile.

234
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
The MNO just charges an MVNE when that happens.

235
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
just using minutes or seconds, how you see it.

236
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So looking at an MVNE, they have a different structure.

237
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
They have monthly cost, we have seen them,

238
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and they have usuage related costs, we have seen them,

239
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and besides that we have some administrative costs,

240
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and we can have some infrastructure.

241
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And we can, as an MVNE, choose how much we want.

242
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So getting income now again, is the same like an MNO.
